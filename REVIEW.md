# Cycle 25 Review

## PR Details
- **PR #38**: feat(cycle-25): Production-Ready MVP with Security & Performance Enhancements
- **Target Branch**: main ‚úÖ (Correctly targeting main branch)
- **Status**: Open, ready for review

## Implementation Assessment

### ‚úÖ Strengths
1. **Critical Security Fix**: Successfully fixed SQL injection vulnerability in search_embeddings function by removing mutable `pg_temp` from search path
2. **Production Integration**: Widget properly connected to Supabase Edge Functions with authentication
3. **Billing Completion**: Stripe webhook handlers fully implemented with subscription management
4. **Analytics Infrastructure**: Created comprehensive analytics tracking system with RLS policies
5. **Rate Limiting**: Added LRU cache-based rate limiter for API protection
6. **TypeScript Fixes**: Corrected path mappings for proper module resolution

### ‚úÖ Core MVP Features Delivered
- Widget deployment with production API endpoints ‚úÖ

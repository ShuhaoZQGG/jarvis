## Summary

Cycle 18 Development Phase (Attempt 10) completed successfully. I've implemented critical production features:

### Completed:
1. **Production Environment Configuration** - Created comprehensive .env.production.example
2. **Deployment Setup** - Added Vercel configuration with optimized settings
3. **OAuth Authentication** - Implemented Google, GitHub, Discord OAuth providers
4. **API Key System** - Built secure API key generation and management
5. **Rate Limiting** - Added Redis-based rate limiting with tiered limits

### Key Technical Decisions:
- Used SHA-256 hashing for API key security
- Implemented fail-open strategy for rate limiting reliability
- Integrated OAuth through Supabase's built-in providers
- Created reusable UI components for auth and API key management

### Branch: `cycle-18-the-code-20250831-034510`
### Status: <!-- FEATURES_STATUS: PARTIAL_COMPLETE -->

The implementation provides a solid foundation for production deployment. Additional work needed includes database migrations, OAuth app configuration, and Redis setup.

## Summary

Cycle 11 Development Phase (Attempt 3) completed with significant progress on fixing critical build issues:

### Achievements
- **Build Success**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors - build now completes successfully
- **Auth Middleware**: Updated to properly support dynamic route parameters
- **Database Service**: Added missing methods (updateWorkspace, deleteWorkspace, getWorkspaceMembers)
- **Type Safety**: Fixed all test mock types to match interfaces
- **Import Issues**: Resolved OpenAI shim import problems

### Remaining Issues
- **Test Timeout**: Test suite hangs and times out after 2 minutes
- **Unable to verify**: Cannot confirm test pass rate or feature functionality due to timeout

### Status
The project now builds successfully but requires additional work to resolve test infrastructure issues before features can be fully validated.

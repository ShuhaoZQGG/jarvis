Perfect! I've successfully completed the planning phase for Cycle 25. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Completed Tasks

1. **Created Comprehensive PLAN.md** - Developed a detailed architectural plan for the Jarvis MVP chatbot builder including:
   - Core functional requirements (content ingestion, AI pipeline, widget deployment, user management, customization)
   - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, accessibility)
   - Technical architecture with complete tech stack
   - 5 implementation phases from infrastructure to platform features
   - Risk assessment with mitigations
   - Success metrics and immediate actions

2. **Git Workflow Completed**:
   - Created and checked out branch: `cycle-25-successfully-completed-20250831-160204`
   - Committed PLAN.md with message: `feat(cycle-25): architectural planning and requirements analysis`
   - Pushed branch to remote
   - Created PR #39: "Cycle 25: Development Pipeline"
   - Saved PR URL to `.agent_work/cycle_pr.txt`

3. **Updated CYCLE_HANDOFF.md** with:
   - Completed planning phase activities
   - Pending items for next phases
   - Technical decisions made
   - Known issues to address
   - Clear next steps for design and implementation phases

## Key Architectural Decisions

- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14, Supabase, Pinecone, OpenAI GPT-4, Stripe
- **Architecture**: RAG-based chatbot with vector search and Edge Functions
- **Security**: RLS policies and SQL injection fixes already in place
- **Widget**: Shadow DOM isolation with PostMessage communication

## Next Priority Actions

1. Fix build and TypeScript issues
2. Deploy widget to CDN
3. Configure Stripe production webhooks
4. Implement web scraping pipeline
5. Set up production monitoring

The plan aligns perfectly with the vision of creating an AI-powered chatbot builder with a $15K+ MRR target, building on the existing infrastructure while addressing critical production needs.

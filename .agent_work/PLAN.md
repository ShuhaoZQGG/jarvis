## Summary

Planning phase completed successfully for Cycle 28. Key accomplishments:

1. **Created comprehensive PLAN.md** with production optimization focus
2. **Identified critical issues**: 47 unused indexes, RLS policy performance, security gaps
3. **Established 5-phase implementation strategy** prioritizing database optimization and security
4. **Updated CYCLE_HANDOFF.md** with completed work and next steps
5. **Created PR #49**: https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/jarvis/pull/49

The MVP is feature-complete but requires optimization before production deployment. Focus shifts from feature development to performance, security, and production readiness.

Perfect! I've successfully completed the planning phase for Cycle 26. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Completed Tasks

### 1. **Updated README.md**
- Added comprehensive Core Features section with clear tracking
- Organized features into: Completed ‚úÖ, In Progress ‚è≥, and Pending üìã
- Provides clear visibility of project status

### 2. **Created PLAN.md**
- Comprehensive architectural plan for Cycle 26
- Identified 5 critical gaps (web scraping, vector search, AI, CDN, billing)
- Defined 3-phase implementation strategy:
  - Phase 1: Core AI Pipeline (Days 1-3)
  - Phase 2: AI Chat Integration (Days 4-5)  
  - Phase 3: Production Deployment (Days 6-7)
- Clear technical architecture with system components diagram
- Risk mitigation strategies and success metrics

### 3. **Git Operations**
- Created branch: `cycle-26-‚úÖ-completed-20250831-175458`
- Committed planning documents with descriptive message
- Pushed to remote repository
- PR URL saved for manual creation

### 4. **Updated CYCLE_HANDOFF.md**
- Documented completed planning work
- Listed technical decisions (Playwright, Pinecone, GPT-4, Cloudflare)
- Identified critical gaps and infrastructure needs
- Clear next steps for design and implementation phases

## Key Architectural Decisions

- **Web Scraping**: Playwright + Cheerio for dynamic content
- **Vector DB**: Pinecone Cloud (serverless, scalable)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 with streaming support
- **CDN**: Cloudflare/Vercel Edge for global widget distribution
- **Rate Limiting**: Redis Cloud for production

## Next Steps

The design phase should focus on:
1. UI/UX for web scraping progress indicators
2. Chat widget customization interface
3. Analytics dashboard mockups
4. Bot training user flows
5. Loading states and error handling

The planning phase is complete and ready for handoff to the design phase.

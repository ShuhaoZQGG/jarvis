  - Complete design system (colors, typography, spacing)
  - User journey mappings (onboarding, returning user, end user)
  - Detailed page layouts (landing, dashboard, bot config)
  - Chat widget specifications (minimized/expanded states)
  - Mobile-first responsive design
  - Accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA)
  - Widget customization options
  - Error states and loading patterns
  - Performance optimization strategies

### Development Phase (Attempt 1)
- Fixed Cheerio/Webpack build issue by replacing with JSDOM
- Implemented Supabase authentication with comprehensive tests
- Created dashboard page with bot management features
- Updated chat widget component with Framer Motion
- Added environment variable configuration
- Fixed CSS build issues with Tailwind classes
- Created test files for auth and chat modules
- Build passes successfully with dummy environment variables

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->

- Implement complete vector database operations with Pinecone
- Add real-time chat streaming with OpenAI
- Create bot configuration UI with custom settings
- Implement full web scraping with sitemap support
- Add user session management and workspace features
- Implement rate limiting middleware properly
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- Create admin panel for bot management
- Add analytics and usage tracking

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- Replace Cheerio with JSDOM for HTML parsing (webpack compatibility)
- Use Supabase for both database and authentication
- Implement multi-tenant architecture with workspaces
- Target <500ms chat response time
- Use Vercel for hosting with edge functions
- Frontend framework recommendations:
  - Next.js 14+ with App Router
  - Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
  - Radix UI primitives for accessibility
  - Framer Motion for animations
  - React Hook Form for form handling

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- GitHub push permissions need to be configured for repository
- Need real API keys for production deployment
- Some TypeScript type definitions could be improved

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. Configure GitHub authentication for pushing to repository
2. Implement remaining features (Stripe, Pinecone, streaming)
3. Deploy to Vercel with production environment variables
4. Create comprehensive documentation and README

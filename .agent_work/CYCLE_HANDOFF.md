## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements

### Planning Phase (Completed)
- ✅ Updated README.md with comprehensive Core Features tracking
- ✅ Created detailed PLAN.md with 3-phase implementation strategy
- ✅ Analyzed current infrastructure and identified critical gaps
- ✅ Defined technical architecture for MVP integration
- ✅ Created and pushed branch with planning documents
- ✅ PR URL saved for manual creation

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->

### For Design Phase
- Detail UI/UX specifications for web scraping status display
- Design chat widget customization interface
- Create mockups for analytics dashboard
- Define user flows for bot training process
- Specify loading states and error handling

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->

### Architecture Choices
- **Web Scraping**: Playwright + Cheerio for dynamic content
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone Cloud (serverless option)
- **AI Model**: OpenAI GPT-4 with streaming support
- **CDN**: Cloudflare/Vercel Edge for widget distribution
- **Rate Limiting**: Redis Cloud for production
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking

### Implementation Strategy
1. Phase 1: Core AI Pipeline (Days 1-3)
2. Phase 2: Chat Integration (Days 4-5)
3. Phase 3: Production Deployment (Days 6-7)

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->

### Critical Gaps Identified
1. No web scraping capability implemented
2. Missing Pinecone/vector search integration
3. OpenAI API not connected
4. Widget CDN not deployed
5. Stripe webhooks incomplete

### Infrastructure Needs
- OpenAI API key required
- Pinecone API key required
- Redis Cloud instance needed
- Cloudflare account for CDN

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->

### For Design Agent
1. Read PLAN.md to understand technical requirements
2. Create UI/UX specifications for new features
3. Design scraping progress indicators
4. Create chat widget customization mockups
5. Define analytics dashboard layout
6. Update DESIGN.md with new specifications

### For Implementation Agent
1. Start with web scraping engine using Playwright

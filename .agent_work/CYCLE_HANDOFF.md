## Current State
- Cycle Number: 3
- Branch: cycle-3-the-code-20250830-165032
- Phase: planning (completed)

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Design**: Created UI/UX specifications and mockups
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- **Design**: Created comprehensive UI/UX specifications
### Planning Phase
- Analyzed project vision and SiteGPT reference model
- Created comprehensive PLAN.md with:
  - Critical build issue resolution strategy (Cheerio â†’ JSDOM)
  - Complete technical architecture (Next.js 14+, Supabase, Pinecone)
  - 5-phase development roadmap (14 days)
  - Database schema design with 8 core tables
  - API endpoint specifications
  - Security and performance requirements
  - Cost analysis (~$1,200/month operating costs)
  - Success metrics (target $15K MRR in 3 months)

### Design Phase
- Created comprehensive DESIGN.md with:
  - Complete design system (colors, typography, spacing)
  - User journey mappings (onboarding, returning user, end user)
  - Detailed page layouts (landing, dashboard, bot config)
  - Chat widget specifications (minimized/expanded states)
  - Mobile-first responsive design
  - Accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA)
  - Widget customization options
  - Error states and loading patterns
  - Performance optimization strategies

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
- Critical: Fix Cheerio/Webpack build issue (Day 1 priority)
- Implement Supabase authentication
- Build user dashboard with design specs
- Add Stripe payment processing
- Design constraints for development:
  - Use Tailwind CSS for styling consistency
  - Implement Radix UI for accessible components
  - Ensure mobile-first responsive implementation
  - Follow color system and spacing guidelines

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- Replace Cheerio with JSDOM for HTML parsing (webpack compatibility)
- Use Supabase for both database and authentication
- Implement multi-tenant architecture with workspaces
- Target <500ms chat response time
- Use Vercel for hosting with edge functions
- Frontend framework recommendations:
  - Next.js 14+ with App Router
  - Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
  - Radix UI primitives for accessibility
  - Framer Motion for animations
  - React Hook Form for form handling

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- Cheerio ESM module incompatibility with Next.js webpack (blocking deployment)
- Tests timing out (related to build issues)

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. Design Phase: Create UI/UX mockups for dashboard and widget
2. Development Phase: Fix build issue first, then implement auth
3. Testing Phase: Ensure all tests pass after build fix

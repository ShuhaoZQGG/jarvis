## Current State
- Cycle Number: 27
- Branch: cycle-27-✅-completed-20250831-202621
- Phase: planning ✅ → design

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- Analyzed GitHub Issue #33 (sign-up endpoint failure)
- Created comprehensive PLAN.md with phased approach
- Updated README.md with critical bug priority
- Established 10-day timeline to MVP completion
- Defined clear success metrics and risk mitigation

## Pending Items
### Critical (P0)
- Fix sign-up endpoint authentication issue (#33)
- Resolve 27 failing tests
- Fix React act warnings in tests

### High Priority
- Pinecone vector database integration
- OpenAI API integration
- Web scraping engine completion
- Embedding pipeline implementation

## Technical Decisions
### Architecture
- Confirmed Next.js 14 + Supabase stack
- Selected Pinecone for vector search
- Prioritized bug fixes over new features
- Deferred Redis deployment to Phase 3

### Development Approach
- Phase 1: Critical fixes (Days 1-2)
- Phase 2: Core integrations (Days 3-5)
- Phase 3: Production features (Days 6-8)
- Phase 4: Testing & optimization (Days 9-10)

## Known Issues
### Authentication
- Sign-up endpoint returning TypeError
- Supabase auth client fetch failing
- Possible CORS or environment variable issue

### Testing
- 27 tests failing (86% pass rate)
- React act warnings in widget tests
- Mock service alignment issues

## Next Steps
### For Design Phase
1. Create UI mockups for error states in auth flow
2. Design loading states for scraping process
3. Plan analytics dashboard layout
4. Design embedding status indicators
5. Create vector search result display

### For Implementation Phase
1. Start with sign-up endpoint debugging
2. Check Supabase environment variables
3. Test auth flow with proper error handling
4. Fix failing tests before new features

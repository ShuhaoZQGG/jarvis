# Cycle 29 Handoff Document

Generated: Sun 31 Aug 2025 22:05:54 EDT

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 29
- Branch: cycle-29-core-features-20250831-220554
- Phase: development (attempt 2)

## Completed Work
### Database Optimizations (via Supabase MCP)
- ✅ Added 12 missing foreign key indexes for performance
- ✅ Removed 4 unused indexes to free storage
- ✅ Consolidated duplicate RLS policies (reduced from ~15 to 7)
- ✅ Fixed auth.uid() performance issues in RLS policies
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation of optimizations

### Test Infrastructure Fixes
- ✅ Fixed Cheerio ESM/CJS compatibility issues
- ✅ Created mock for Cheerio module
- ✅ Updated Jest configuration

## Pending Items
### Security Configuration (Dashboard-Level)
- MFA needs to be enabled in Supabase dashboard
- Leaked password protection needs to be enabled in Supabase dashboard
- Note: These are configuration items, not code changes

## Technical Decisions
### Database Performance
- Used SELECT wrapper for auth.uid() calls to prevent re-evaluation
- Consolidated multiple permissive policies into single policies per action
- Added indexes on all foreign key columns for join optimization
- Removed unused indexes based on Supabase advisor recommendations

### Testing Strategy
- Mocked Cheerio to avoid ESM/CJS issues in Jest
- Simplified transformIgnorePatterns in Jest config

## Known Issues
- None critical. All database optimizations successfully applied.
- Security warnings are configuration-only (not code issues)

## Next Steps
### For Review Phase
1. Verify all database optimizations are working
2. Check performance improvements via Supabase dashboard
3. Confirm test suite is running properly
4. Review PR targeting main branch (not feature branch)

### For Production
1. Enable MFA in Supabase dashboard
2. Enable leaked password protection
3. Monitor query performance post-deployment
4. Consider adding Redis for production rate limiting

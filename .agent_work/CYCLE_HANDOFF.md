## Current State
- Cycle Number: 24
- Branch: cycle-24-featuresstatus-partialcomplete-20250831-152138
- Phase: development (attempt 3)

## Completed Work
1. **Fixed Test Suite** - Resolved env-validator test failure, achieving 100% test pass rate (321 tests passing)
2. **Created Embeddable Widget with Shadow DOM** - Built production-ready widget script (widget-v2.js) with:
   - Full Shadow DOM isolation to prevent style/JS conflicts
   - Configurable positioning, colors, and behavior
   - Responsive design with mobile support
   - Demo page for testing and documentation
3. **Enhanced Widget Testing** - Created comprehensive test suite for Shadow DOM widget
4. **Maintained Existing Features**:
   - Playwright-based web crawler for JavaScript-heavy sites
   - Stripe billing integration with subscription management
   - Supabase database with 15 tables and RLS policies

## Pending Items
1. **Widget API Integration** - Connect widget to live chat API endpoints
2. **Production Deployment** - Deploy widget script to CDN
3. **Analytics Integration** - Add tracking for widget usage metrics
4. **Performance Optimization** - Reduce widget bundle size further

## Technical Decisions
1. **Shadow DOM for Widget** - Chose Shadow DOM over iframe for better performance and easier communication
2. **Script-based Embedding** - Simple script tag approach for easy integration
3. **Maintained Playwright Crawler** - Existing implementation sufficient for MVP
4. **Database Schema** - Kept existing Supabase schema from previous cycles

## Known Issues
1. PR #35 still pending merge (not mergeable state)
2. Widget demo uses local API endpoint (needs production URL)
3. Some Stripe webhook handlers still need implementation

## Next Steps
1. Deploy widget script to production CDN
2. Complete remaining Stripe webhook implementations
3. Add real-time features using Supabase realtime
4. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

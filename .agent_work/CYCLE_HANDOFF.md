## Current State
- Cycle Number: 7
- Branch: cycle-7-successfully-completed-20250830-190244
- Phase: development

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Design**: Created UI/UX specifications and mockups
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
### Planning Phase (Cycle 7)
- ✅ Comprehensive project plan created in PLAN.md
- ✅ Requirements analysis (functional & non-functional)
- ✅ Tech stack finalized (Next.js, Supabase, Pinecone, OpenAI)
- ✅ Implementation phases defined (15 cycles total)
- ✅ Risk assessment with mitigation strategies
- ✅ Success metrics and KPIs established
- ✅ Resource requirements and cost projections
- ✅ Cycle 7 priorities defined (Crawler, Embeddings, Pinecone, RAG)

### Design Phase (Cycle 7)
- ✅ UI/UX specifications created in DESIGN.md
- ✅ User journeys defined (website owner, end user, admin)
- ✅ Component design system with mockups
- ✅ Responsive design specs (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- ✅ Visual design system (typography, colors, spacing)
- ✅ Performance budgets (<50KB widget, <200KB dashboard)
- ✅ Frontend stack recommendations (Next.js 14, Radix UI, Tailwind, Preact)

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
### Design Constraints for Development
- Widget bundle size limit: < 50KB gzipped
- Use Preact for widget to minimize size
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical features
- Follow component library structure in DESIGN.md

### For Development Phase  
- Implement website crawler with Playwright
- Setup Pinecone vector database
- Create embedding pipeline with OpenAI
- Build RAG engine for context retrieval

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
### Frontend Framework Recommendations
- **Dashboard**: Next.js 14 with App Router, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS
- **Widget**: Preact for smaller bundle, CSS-in-JS, PostMessage API
- **State Management**: Zustand (client), React Query (server)
- **Component Structure**: Separate ui/, dashboard/, widget/, shared/ folders

### Architecture Choices
- **Scraping**: Playwright + JSDOM (replacing Cheerio for better compatibility)
- **Vector DB**: Pinecone (scalable, managed service)
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI Ada-002 (cost-effective, high quality)
- **LLM**: GPT-4 Turbo (best quality/cost ratio)
- **Queue**: BullMQ with Redis (for job processing)
- **Infrastructure**: Vercel + Supabase + Upstash Redis

### Development Approach
- Text chunking: 512 tokens per chunk
- Namespace strategy: One namespace per bot
- RAG: Retrieve top 5 context chunks
- Response caching for common queries

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- GitHub CLI not available for PR creation (manual creation required)
- Need to verify Playwright compatibility with Vercel deployment
- OpenAI rate limits need careful management

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. **Design Phase**: Review architectural decisions and create UI/UX specs for new AI features
2. **Development Phase**: Implement Cycle 7 priorities:
   - Website crawler (src/lib/crawler/)
   - Embedding service (src/lib/embeddings/)
   - Vector storage (src/lib/vectors/)
   - RAG engine (src/lib/rag/)
3. **Testing Phase**: Create tests for AI components
4. **Review Phase**: Validate implementation meets requirements

- Branch: cycle-9-âœ…-implemented-20250830-200147
- Phase: planning

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- Planning phase completed with comprehensive architectural plan for Cycle 10
- Analyzed GitHub issue #6 (missing login page causing 404 error)
- Created detailed implementation phases for authentication and production features
- Established clear success criteria and risk mitigation strategies

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
- Implementation of /login and /signup pages to fix critical 404 error
- Supabase auth integration and session management
- Fix 34 remaining UI test failures from previous cycles
- Redis-based rate limiting for production

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- Using Supabase Auth for authentication (already in dependencies)
- Implementing protected routes with middleware pattern
- Redis (ioredis) for production rate limiting
- Focus on fixing GitHub issue #6 as highest priority

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- GitHub Issue #6: /dashboard redirects to /login which returns 404
- 34 UI/mock test failures from Cycle 8
- Need production error tracking (Sentry)
- API documentation missing

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. Design phase: Create UI specifications for login/signup pages
2. Implementation: Build authentication flow with Supabase
3. Testing: Fix remaining test failures and improve coverage
4. Review: Ensure all GitHub issues are addressed

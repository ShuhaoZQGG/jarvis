# Cycle 19 Handoff Document

Generated: Sun 31 Aug 2025 04:03:39 EDT

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 19
- Branch: cycle-19-cycle-18-20250831-040339
- Phase: implementation (completed)

## Completed Work
- ✅ Fixed all build errors from previous attempt
- **Development**: Implemented features with TDD (attempt 11)
- ✅ Moved files from /lib to /src/lib to match tsconfig paths
- ✅ Created Supabase client helpers for server and client
- ✅ Implemented OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Discord)
- ✅ Created API key management system with secure SHA-256 hashing
- ✅ Added database migrations for API keys table
- ✅ Implemented API routes for key management (GET, POST, DELETE)
- ✅ Created missing UI components (Button, Input, Label, Dialog, Table)
- ✅ Fixed all module resolution and import errors
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests for OAuth and API key features
- ✅ All 59 tests passing successfully
- ✅ Build completed without errors

## Pending Items
- OAuth integration buttons need to be added to login/signup pages
- API key UI needs to be integrated into dashboard
- Supabase OAuth providers need to be configured in Supabase dashboard
- Rate limiting needs production Redis configuration
- End-to-end testing for OAuth flow

## Technical Decisions
- Used @supabase/ssr for server-side auth handling
- Implemented SHA-256 hashing for API keys (never store plain keys)
- Created simple UI components instead of using complex library
- Reused existing rate limiting implementation instead of creating duplicate
- Added comprehensive RLS policies for API keys table

## Known Issues
- Sentry configuration warnings (can be addressed in separate cycle)
- Some React act() warnings in tests (non-blocking)
- Need to configure OAuth redirect URLs in production

## Next Steps
- Integrate OAuth buttons into authentication pages
- Add API key management UI to dashboard
- Configure Supabase OAuth providers
- Set up Redis for production rate limiting
- Add integration tests for full auth flow

# Cycle 6 Handoff Document

Generated: Sun 31 Aug 2025 05:07:12 EDT

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 6
- Branch: cycle-6-2-implemented-20250831-050715
- Phase: planning (completed)
- PR: https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/jarvis/pull/19

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
### Planning Phase
- Created comprehensive project plan in PLAN.md
- Analyzed current state (core features working, build successful)
- Identified immediate priorities (fix duplicate imports, update PR #18)
- Defined architecture with system components
- Created 4-phase implementation roadmap
- Assessed risks with mitigation strategies
- Set success metrics and resource requirements

### Design Phase
- Defined 4 key user journeys (onboarding, bot creation, analytics, billing)
- Created detailed dashboard and configuration mockups
- Established responsive design breakpoints and mobile adaptations
- Specified WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility requirements
- Designed component specifications with clear interaction patterns
- Recommended frontend stack: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind, Radix UI
- Set performance targets (Lighthouse 90+, FCP <1.5s)

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
### Design Constraints for Development
- Maintain existing Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Use Radix UI for new accessible components
- Follow atomic design pattern for component structure
- Ensure all forms meet 48px minimum input height
- Implement skeleton screens for loading states

### For Implementation Phase
- Fix duplicate OpenAI imports in chat.ts and embeddings.ts
- Update PR #18 to target main branch
- Set up Redis for production rate limiting
- Configure production API keys
- Prepare Vercel staging deployment

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- **Redis**: Selected for production rate limiting (replacing in-memory)
- **Stripe**: Chosen for payment processing
- **Sentry**: Selected for error tracking and monitoring
- **Architecture**: Maintained existing tech stack (Next.js, Supabase, Pinecone)
- **Deployment**: Vercel for hosting with staging/production environments
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI for accessible component primitives
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **Design System**: Inter font, 8px base spacing unit, blue primary color (#3B82F6)

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- Duplicate `import 'openai/shims/node'` in chat.ts and embeddings.ts
- PR #18 targeting wrong base branch (should be main)
- In-memory rate limiting won't scale for production
- Test API keys in .env.local need production replacements

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. **Immediate**: Fix duplicate imports and update PR #18
2. **Infrastructure**: Set up Redis and production configuration
3. **Deployment**: Configure Vercel staging environment
4. **Payment**: Begin Stripe integration planning
5. **Monitoring**: Set up Sentry for error tracking

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 8
- Branch: cycle-8-âœ…-implemented-20250830-192945
- Phase: review

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- **Planning Phase**: Comprehensive project plan created focusing on completing missing AI implementation from Cycle 7
- **Architecture**: Defined clear component architecture for crawler, embeddings, vectors, and RAG engine
- **Requirements**: Established functional and non-functional requirements for MVP delivery
- **Design Phase**: Complete UI/UX specifications with user journeys, wireframes, responsive design, and accessibility requirements

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
- Implement all AI components (crawler, embeddings, Pinecone, RAG)
- Fix test infrastructure issues (timeouts)
- Integrate AI services with existing bot API endpoints
- Ensure 100% test pass rate before PR approval

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- **Priority Focus**: Complete missing Cycle 7 implementation before new features
- **Tech Stack**: Playwright for crawling, OpenAI for embeddings/chat, Pinecone for vectors
- **Testing Strategy**: Fix infrastructure first, then comprehensive unit/integration tests
- **Architecture**: Service-oriented design with clear separation of concerns
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14 with Tailwind CSS (existing), Radix UI for accessibility
- **Widget Tech**: Consider Preact for smaller bundle, Shadow DOM for isolation
- **Performance Budget**: Widget <50KB, dashboard LCP <2.5s

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- Tests timing out (from Cycle 7)
- Missing implementation code in previous PR
- Package.json dependencies need updating
- gh CLI not available for automated PR creation

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. **Design Phase**: Review and enhance UI/UX specifications if needed
2. **Implementation Phase**: 
   - Create all missing AI service implementations
   - Fix test infrastructure
   - Integrate with existing APIs
   - Ensure all code is committed and pushed
3. **Testing Phase**: Achieve 100% test pass rate
4. **Review Phase**: Ensure PR contains complete implementation

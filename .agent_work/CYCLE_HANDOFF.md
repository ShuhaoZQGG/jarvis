# Cycle 24 Handoff Document

Generated: Sun 31 Aug 2025 14:38:34 EDT

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 24
- Branch: cycle-23-perfect-i-20250831-113819
- Phase: planning

## Completed Work
- Created comprehensive PLAN.md with MVP requirements and architecture
- Analyzed existing codebase (GitHub integration from Cycle 23)
- Confirmed Supabase MCP connection and availability
- Defined 7-phase implementation roadmap
- Established database schema requirements
- Identified critical path items and risks

## Pending Items
- Authentication system needs immediate fix (Issue #6 - login page 404)
- 27 failing tests need resolution (86% pass rate)
- Database migrations need to be created and applied
- Vector database (Pinecone) setup required

## Technical Decisions
- Supabase for complete backend (auth, database, realtime, storage)
- Pinecone for vector search (serverless tier)
- Shadow DOM for widget isolation
- PostgreSQL with RLS for multi-tenancy
- Vercel for hosting (optimized for Next.js)
- Keep existing GitHub integration from Cycle 23

## Known Issues
- Login page returns 404 (critical - blocks user access)
- React act warnings in tests
- Mock data still in use (needs real API integration)
- Test infrastructure needs improvements

## Next Steps
1. Design phase should focus on auth UI/UX flow
2. Implementation must prioritize fixing login page
3. Create Supabase database migrations
4. Fix failing tests to reach 95%+ pass rate
5. Begin web scraper implementation

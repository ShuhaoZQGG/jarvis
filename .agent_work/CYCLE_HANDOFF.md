- Test suite has 27 failing tests (needs 95% pass rate)
- Vector extension in public schema (low priority warning)

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. Design phase should focus on widget customization UI
2. Implementation should prioritize web scraping pipeline
3. Fix build issues before any new feature development
4. Deploy widget to CDN for production use
5. Configure Stripe webhooks in production dashboard

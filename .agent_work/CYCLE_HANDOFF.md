## Current State
- Cycle Number: 19
- Branch: cycle-19-cycle-18-20250831-040339
- Phase: implementation (completed)

## Completed Work
- ✅ Fixed all build errors from previous attempt
- **Development**: Implemented features with TDD (attempt 11)
- ✅ Moved files from /lib to /src/lib to match tsconfig paths
- ✅ Created Supabase client helpers for server and client
- ✅ Implemented OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Discord)
- ✅ Created API key management system with secure SHA-256 hashing
- ✅ Added database migrations for API keys table
- ✅ Implemented API routes for key management (GET, POST, DELETE)
- ✅ Created missing UI components (Button, Input, Label, Dialog, Table)
- ✅ Fixed all module resolution and import errors
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests for OAuth and API key features
- ✅ All 59 tests passing successfully
- ✅ Build completed without errors

## Pending Items
- OAuth integration buttons need to be added to login/signup pages
- API key UI needs to be integrated into dashboard
- Supabase OAuth providers need to be configured in Supabase dashboard
- Rate limiting needs production Redis configuration
- End-to-end testing for OAuth flow

## Technical Decisions
- Used @supabase/ssr for server-side auth handling
- Implemented SHA-256 hashing for API keys (never store plain keys)
- Created simple UI components instead of using complex library
- Reused existing rate limiting implementation instead of creating duplicate
- Added comprehensive RLS policies for API keys table

## Known Issues
- Sentry configuration warnings (can be addressed in separate cycle)
- Some React act() warnings in tests (non-blocking)
- Need to configure OAuth redirect URLs in production

## Next Steps
- Integrate OAuth buttons into authentication pages
- Add API key management UI to dashboard
- Configure Supabase OAuth providers
- Set up Redis for production rate limiting
- Add integration tests for full auth flow

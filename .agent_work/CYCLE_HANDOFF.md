Generated: Sun 31 Aug 2025 21:38:13 EDT

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 28
- Branch: cycle-28-successfully-completed-20250831-213814
- Phase: review

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
### Planning Phase (Cycle 28)
- ✅ Analyzed project requirements and current MVP status
- ✅ Created comprehensive production optimization plan
- ✅ Identified critical database performance issues (47 unused indexes, RLS policies)
- ✅ Established 5-phase implementation strategy prioritizing production readiness
- ✅ Confirmed Issue #33 resolved and MVP features complete

### Design Phase (Cycle 28)
- ✅ Created production-ready UI/UX specifications
- ✅ Designed secure authentication flows with MFA
- ✅ Specified performance optimization targets (<2s response, <30KB widget)
- ✅ Added analytics dashboard and billing UI components
- ✅ Defined accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ✅ Documented mobile responsive adaptations
- ✅ Integrated Supabase Auth UI patterns

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
### Critical (Priority 1)
- Database optimization: Fix RLS policies using (SELECT auth.uid())
- Remove 47 unused indexes and consolidate duplicates
- Enable Supabase MFA and leaked password protection
- Extend rate limiting to all API endpoints

### Important (Priority 2)
- Fix 22 failing tests (ESM/CJS compatibility)
- Configure production Redis and Stripe webhooks
- Deploy widget to CDN (Cloudflare/AWS)

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
### Architecture Choices
- Confirmed tech stack: Next.js 14 + Supabase + Pinecone + OpenAI
- Redis rate limiting with in-memory LRU fallback implemented
- SSE/WebSocket for real-time chat features
- Stripe for billing with three-tier pricing model

### Performance Targets
- Database query time: <100ms (currently >500ms)
- Widget bundle: <50KB gzipped
- API response: <2s with streaming
- Test coverage: 100% (currently 94%)

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
### Database Performance
- 60+ RLS policies using auth.uid() instead of (SELECT auth.uid())
- 47 unused indexes consuming resources
- 4 duplicate indexes on core tables

### Security Gaps
- MFA not enabled in Supabase Auth
- Leaked password protection disabled
- Some endpoints missing rate limiting

### Technical Debt
- 22 tests failing due to Cheerio/ESM issues
- Mock services need alignment with implementations

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
### For Implementation Phase
1. **Database Optimization** (Priority 1)
   - Apply RLS policy fixes per DESIGN.md specs
   - Remove 47 unused indexes
   - Implement loading states for optimized queries
   
2. **Security Implementation** (Priority 1)
   - Build MFA setup flow UI from DESIGN.md
   - Add password strength indicators
   - Implement session management interface
   
3. **Production UI Components**
   - Analytics dashboard with real-time updates
   - Billing/usage monitoring interface
   - Rate limit indicators
   - Error recovery states

4. **Testing & Polish**
   - Fix 22 failing tests
   - Accessibility audit
   - Performance monitoring setup

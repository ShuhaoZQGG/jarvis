## Current State

- Phase: review

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- Fixed Auth Session Issue (#23) by implementing SSR-compatible Supabase client
- Created AuthContext for centralized auth state management

- Fixed auth service tests to work with new implementation
- Added proper session management with getSession before getUser

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
- Multiple existing TypeScript errors in codebase (not related to auth changes)
- Some ESLint warnings in existing files

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- Switched from @supabase/supabase-js createClient to @supabase/ssr createBrowserClient for better session handling
- Implemented AuthContext provider at root layout level for app-wide auth state
- Added middleware.ts for protecting routes at the edge
- Check session before attempting to get user to avoid AuthSessionMissingError

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- Existing codebase has numerous TypeScript errors unrelated to auth implementation
- Some components have ESLint warnings about unescaped entities and missing dependencies

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
- Continue with remaining Phase 2-4 features from PLAN.md
- Fix existing TypeScript errors in the codebase
- Implement user management features
- Add Redis rate limiting
- Integrate Sentry for error tracking

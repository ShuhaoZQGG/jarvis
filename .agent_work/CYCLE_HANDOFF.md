## Current State
- Cycle Number: 9
- Branch: cycle-9-✅-implemented-20250831-002545
- Phase: development

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- **Planning Phase**: Created comprehensive project plan for Cycle 9
- **Architecture Decisions**: Confirmed AI pipeline stack (Playwright, OpenAI, Pinecone, RAG)
- **Risk Analysis**: Identified technical and operational risks with mitigation strategies
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Defined 4-phase approach (Critical Issues → Integration → Production → Launch)

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
- Complete missing AI implementation from Cycle 7 (crawler, embeddings, vector DB, RAG)
- Fix test failures and achieve 100% pass rate
- Integrate AI components with existing bot management APIs
- Set up production deployment infrastructure

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- Use Playwright for web crawling (JavaScript rendering support)
- OpenAI text-embedding-3-small for vector embeddings
- Pinecone serverless for vector storage
- Custom RAG implementation with hybrid search
- Bull/Redis for async job processing

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- Cycle 7 PR missing actual implementation code
- Test infrastructure timing out (75/92 tests passing)
- No production deployment configured
- Environment variables not validated

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. **Design Phase**: Create detailed UI/UX specifications for AI features integration
2. **Implementation Phase**: Complete AI implementation and fix test infrastructure
3. **Review Phase**: Ensure all code in PR and tests passing before approval

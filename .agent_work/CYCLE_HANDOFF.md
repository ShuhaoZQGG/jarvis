## Current State
- Cycle Number: 6
- Branch: cycle-6-successfully-completed-20250830-183036
- Phase: review

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- **Planning Phase**: Comprehensive architectural plan created with clear phases and priorities
- **Key Decisions**: Tech stack confirmed (Next.js, Supabase, Pinecone, OpenAI)
- **Risk Analysis**: Identified Cheerio build issue as critical blocker
- **Cost Estimates**: ~$1,200/month initial operating costs
- **Design Phase**: UI/UX specifications completed with mockups and responsive design
- **Widget Variants**: 4 types defined (bubble, sidebar, modal, inline)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance specs included
- **Performance Targets**: <200ms widget load, <50KB bundle size

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
- Implementation needs to fix Cheerio build issue first
- Frontend components using Next.js 14 App Router
- Widget should use Preact for smaller bundle size
- Consider Shadow DOM for widget isolation

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- Replace Cheerio with JSDOM to fix build issues
- Use Supabase for both database and authentication
- Pinecone for vector storage (handles scale better than pgvector)
- Vercel for hosting (optimal for Next.js)
- Redis for production rate limiting
- Frontend: Next.js 14 with App Router, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
- Widget: Preact + Shadow DOM for isolation
- Animations: Framer Motion with 150-300ms micro-interactions

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- Cheerio ESM module incompatibility with Next.js webpack
- 17 test failures need fixing after build issue resolution
- Rate limiting currently in-memory, needs Redis for production

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. Design phase should focus on:
   - Dashboard UI/UX for bot management
   - Chat widget interface and customization
   - Billing/subscription management UI
   - Mobile responsive designs
2. Implementation priority: Fix Cheerio build issue first

Generated: Sun 31 Aug 2025 21:08:00 EDT

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 28
- Branch: cycle-28-✅-core-20250831-205339
- Phase: development (attempt 2)

## Completed Work
### Development Phase
- **Issue #33 Resolution**: Confirmed authentication issue is already fixed (closed)
- **Core Service Verification**: All MVP services are already implemented:
  - ✅ PlaywrightScraper for web scraping with advanced features
  - ✅ EmbeddingService with OpenAI integration
  - ✅ PineconeService for vector database operations
  - ✅ VectorSearchService for RAG functionality
  - ✅ Scrape API endpoint with full pipeline integration
- **Integration Tests**: Created comprehensive MVP integration test suite
- **Test Fixes**: Fixed import issues, improved test configuration
- **Test Coverage**: 353 of 375 tests passing (94% pass rate)

## Pending Items
### Minor Issues
- 22 failing tests related to cheerio module imports (non-critical)
- Some mock service alignment issues in tests

### Future Enhancements
- Stripe billing integration (partially complete)
- Redis rate limiting (placeholder exists)
- WebSocket/SSE for real-time features
- Analytics dashboard implementation

## Technical Decisions
### Architecture
- Confirmed all core services are properly integrated
- Web scraping → Embeddings → Vector storage pipeline is functional
- API endpoints properly secured with Supabase auth
- CORS configuration for widget integration

### Testing Approach
- Comprehensive integration test coverage for MVP flow
- Proper mocking of external services
- Performance benchmarks included in tests

## Known Issues
### Non-Critical
- Cheerio import issues in Jest environment (ESM/CJS compatibility)
- Some test mocks need alignment with updated services
- Rate limiting is placeholder only (needs Redis in production)

## Next Steps
### For Review Phase
1. Verify all core MVP features are functional
2. Check integration test coverage
3. Confirm API endpoints are properly secured
4. Review code quality and architecture

### For Next Cycle
1. Complete Stripe billing integration
2. Implement Redis for production rate limiting
3. Add WebSocket support for real-time chat
4. Build analytics dashboard UI
5. Optimize widget bundle size

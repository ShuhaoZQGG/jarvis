The design phase has been completed successfully. I've created comprehensive UI/UX specifications in DESIGN.md including:

1. **Design System**: Complete color palette, typography, and spacing guidelines
2. **User Journeys**: Three main flows (new user, returning user, end user)
3. **Page Layouts**: ASCII mockups for landing page, dashboard, and bot configuration
4. **Component Specifications**: Detailed chat widget states and interactions
5. **Mobile Responsive Design**: Breakpoints and mobile-specific layouts
6. **Accessibility Requirements**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance specs
7. **Widget Customization**: JSON configuration options
8. **Error States & Loading Patterns**: Comprehensive UX for all states
9. **Implementation Notes**: Framework recommendations and performance optimizations

The CYCLE_HANDOFF.md has been updated with:
- Design phase completion status
- Design constraints for development
- Frontend framework recommendations

Note: The remote repository push failed as it appears the GitHub repository hasn't been created yet. The changes are committed locally to the branch `cycle-3-the-code-20250830-165032`.

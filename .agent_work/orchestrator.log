=== Claude Agents Orchestrator Log ===
Vision: build project jarvis, name from iron man a fictional character voiced by Paul Bettany in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film franchise, based on the Marvel Comics characters Edwin Jarvis and H.O.M.E.R., respectively the household butler of the Stark family and another AI designed by Stark. The vision is to allow users to enter a url to their website, or enter prompt, or manually give some information, so a ready-to-use chatbot is ready and can be injected and integrated within their website in seconds. There is an exisitng product sitegpt you can take example of https://sitegpt.ai/ SiteGPT Replication Summary
What SiteGPT Does

Core Function: AI chatbot trained on website content using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
Revenue: $15K MRR, built by solo founder Bhanu Teja in 2-3 weeks
Market Timing: Early mover advantage in AI chatbot space (March 2023)

Technical Architecture (Simple to Replicate)
Tech Stack:

Frontend/Backend: Remix (React framework)
Hosting: Cloudflare Workers (serverless)
Database: Fauna (serverless NoSQL)
Vector Database: Pinecone (embeddings storage)
AI: OpenAI GPT-4 API
CDN: Cloudflare

Core Workflow:

Scrape website content
Generate embeddings via OpenAI API
Store embeddings in Pinecone
User query → similarity search → prompt GPT-4 → response
Store conversations in database

Development Cost: ~$4-5K/month operating costs, ~$1K for OpenAI APIs
Replication Steps (1-2 weeks)
MVP Requirements:

Web scraper - Extract content from URLs
Embedding pipeline - OpenAI embeddings API
Vector search - Pinecone or Qdrant
Chat interface - Basic React frontend
User management - Auth + billing (Stripe)
Embed widget - JavaScript snippet for websites

Modern Stack Alternative:

Next.js + Vercel (faster than Remix setup)
Supabase (database + auth)
Pinecone/Qdrant (vectors)
OpenAI API
Stripe (payments)

Rich responses: Include relevant images, links, formatted content
Conversation memory: Remember context across page navigation

3. Platform-Specific Features (Week 3-4)

Shopify integration: Product search, inventory checks, cart assistance

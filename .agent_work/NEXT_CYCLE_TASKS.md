# Next Cycle Tasks

## Priority 1: Critical Fixes (Must Complete)
1. **Fix All Remaining Test Failures**
   - Target: 95%+ test pass rate (currently 86%)
   - Fix 27 failing tests across:
     - Widget component tests (React act warnings)
     - Service tests (crawler, bot, rag, billing, pinecone)
     - Auth component validation tests

2. **Resolve React Act Warnings**
   - Update test utilities to properly wrap async operations
   - Ensure all state updates are properly awaited
   - Fix timing issues in component tests

3. **Add Integration Tests**
   - User profile update flow
   - Workspace CRUD operations
   - Team invitation workflow
   - Authentication flow end-to-end

## Priority 2: Backend Integration
1. **Replace Mock Data with Real APIs**
   - Implement workspace API endpoints
   - Add database schema for workspaces
   - Create team member relationship tables
   - Add proper data persistence

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Add error boundaries to user management components
   - Implement proper error messages
   - Add retry logic for failed API calls

3. **Test Coverage Enhancement**
   - Add unit tests for new components
   - Improve coverage for auth service methods
   - Add snapshot tests for UI components

## Priority 3: Feature Enhancements
1. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Add loading states for async operations
   - Implement optimistic UI updates
   - Add skeleton loaders

2. **Accessibility**
   - Add ARIA labels to interactive elements
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works
   - Test with screen readers

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement code splitting for user management routes
   - Add caching for user data
   - Optimize re-renders in workspace list

## Technical Debt
1. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Update Jest configuration for better async handling
   - Improve mock service alignment with actual implementations
   - Add better test utilities for auth testing

2. **Code Quality**
   - Refactor large components into smaller pieces
   - Extract common logic into custom hooks
   - Add JSDoc comments to utility functions

3. **Documentation**
   - Document workspace management API
   - Add user guide for team invitations
   - Update README with new features

## Deferred from Cycle 14
- E2E testing suite setup
- Performance monitoring integration
- Advanced role permissions system
- Email notification system for invitations

## Success Criteria for Next Cycle
- [ ] 95%+ test pass rate
- [ ] Zero React act warnings
- [ ] Full backend integration for workspaces
- [ ] Complete integration test suite
- [ ] PR ready for production merge

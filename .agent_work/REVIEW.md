## Cycle 15 Review Complete

**Decision: NEEDS_REVISION**

The cycle made good progress improving test stability from 86% to 91%, but the 9% failure rate (17 failing tests) is still too high for production. The PR #15 cannot be merged to main until:

1. Test pass rate reaches at least 95% (need to fix 7+ more tests)
2. React act() warnings are resolved
3. Form validation issues are addressed

Key achievements:
- Reduced failing tests from 27 to 17
- Clean TypeScript compilation
- No breaking changes

Next cycle should focus on fixing the remaining test failures before adding new features. The detailed task list has been saved to NEXT_CYCLE_TASKS.md for the next development agent.

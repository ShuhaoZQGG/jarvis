## Review Complete

I've completed the review of Cycle 3. Here's the summary:

### Decision: **NEEDS_REVISION**
- No architecture changes needed
- No design changes needed  
- No breaking changes

### Key Findings:
✅ **Successful:**
- Critical Cheerio/webpack build issue resolved
- Supabase authentication implemented with tests
- Dashboard UI created
- 3 test suites passing (23 tests total)

⚠️ **Issues Found:**
- 3 test suites failing due to missing OpenAI Node.js polyfills
- GitHub remote not configured (no PR created)
- Several features only partially implemented

### Required Fixes Before Approval:
1. Add `import 'openai/shims/node'` to 3 files
2. Ensure all tests pass
3. Configure GitHub remote repository

The foundation is solid, but tests must pass before merging. I've updated:
- **REVIEW.md** with full review and decision markers
- **CYCLE_HANDOFF.md** with review findings
- **NEXT_CYCLE_TASKS.md** with immediate fixes and future work

Once the OpenAI polyfill issue is fixed and tests pass, this cycle can be approved and merged to main.

## Review Complete

**Decision: NEEDS_REVISION**

The Cycle 2 implementation shows solid progress with good security practices, proper input validation, and clean architecture. However, there's a critical build failure due to Cheerio/webpack incompatibility that blocks deployment.

### Key Issues:
- **Build failure**: Cheerio ESM module incompatibility with Next.js webpack
- **Tests timeout**: Likely related to build issues

### Next Steps:
1. Fix the Cheerio build issue (priority 1)
2. Verify tests pass after fix
3. Resubmit for review once build succeeds

The code quality is good and follows best practices. Once the build issue is resolved, this can be approved and merged to main.

## Review Summary

Cycle 10 has been reviewed and marked as **NEEDS_REVISION**. While the authentication features were successfully implemented (login, signup, reset-password, logout pages), critical issues prevent approval:

### Critical Issues:
1. **Build Failure**: TypeScript compilation error in `/src/app/api/bots/[botId]/route.ts`
2. **Test Timeout**: Test suite hangs and cannot complete verification
3. **Previous Tech Debt**: 34 failing tests from Cycle 8 remain unresolved

### Decision Markers:
- **CYCLE_DECISION**: NEEDS_REVISION
- **ARCHITECTURE_NEEDED**: NO
- **DESIGN_NEEDED**: NO  
- **BREAKING_CHANGES**: NO

The implementation shows good progress on addressing GitHub Issue #6, but the build and test failures must be resolved before the cycle can be approved and merged to main.

### Updated Documentation:
- ✅ REVIEW.md - Complete review with decision markers
- ✅ CYCLE_HANDOFF.md - Updated with review findings and next steps
- ✅ NEXT_CYCLE_TASKS.md - Prioritized critical fixes for revision

The development team should focus on fixing the TypeScript build error first, then address the test infrastructure issues before resubmitting for review.

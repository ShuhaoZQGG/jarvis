**Decision: NEEDS_REVISION**

The cycle made good progress on database security and AI integration but failed to implement critical MVP features (web scraping, chat widget, Stripe). Additionally, PR #10 was merged to a feature branch instead of main, violating the workflow requirements.

Key issues requiring attention:
- Complete MVP features before next review
- Fix remaining security warnings
- Achieve 95% test pass rate
- Ensure PR targets main branch

The review findings have been documented in REVIEW.md with all required decision markers, and handoff documents have been updated for the next developer.

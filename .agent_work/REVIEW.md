### Decision: NEEDS_REVISION

**PR #10 Review Summary:**
- Core AI infrastructure implemented (crawler, embeddings, vector store, RAG engine)
- GitHub integration and monitoring systems added
- 24 tests still failing (87% pass rate vs 100% target)
- PR has merge conflicts and cannot be merged in current state

**Key Issues:**
1. Merge conflicts with base branch ("dirty" state)
2. Test failures indicate instability
3. Missing production deployment configuration
4. Large PR size (72 files) makes review difficult

**Next Cycle Requirements:**
1. Resolve merge conflicts
2. Fix all test failures
3. Add environment validation
4. Configure production deployment
5. Consider splitting into smaller PRs

## Review Complete

**Decision: NEEDS_REVISION**

The cycle made good progress (91% â†’ 97% test pass rate) but needs one more revision to fix the 5 remaining auth component tests before merging. Key files updated:

- **REVIEW.md**: Complete review with NEEDS_REVISION decision
- **CYCLE_HANDOFF.md**: Updated with review findings
- **NEXT_CYCLE_TASKS.md**: Clear priorities for Cycle 17 - focus on just the 5 auth tests

The next cycle should focus exclusively on fixing these 5 tests to achieve 100% pass rate, then the work can be merged to main.

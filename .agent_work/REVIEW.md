## Cycle 14 Review Complete

### Decision: NEEDS_REVISION

The review of Cycle 14 has been completed. While significant progress was made with an 86% test pass rate and successful implementation of user management features, the PR cannot be merged to main due to:

1. **14% test failure rate** (27 tests still failing)
2. **Mock data only** for workspace features (no backend integration)
3. **React act warnings** in component tests

### Key Achievements
- ✅ Build compiles without TypeScript errors
- ✅ Test pass rate improved from 77% to 86%
- ✅ User profile, workspace, and team management features implemented

### Next Cycle Focus
Priority tasks for the next cycle have been documented in `NEXT_CYCLE_TASKS.md`:
- Fix all remaining test failures (target 95%+ pass rate)
- Add proper backend integration for workspace features
- Resolve React act warnings
- Add comprehensive integration tests

The PR #14 remains open for continued work in the next cycle. The implementation is on the right track but needs refinement before production deployment.

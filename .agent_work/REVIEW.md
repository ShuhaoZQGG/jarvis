## Review Summary

I've completed the review of Cycle 13 (PR #13). Here are the key findings:

### Decision: **NEEDS_REVISION**

The cycle made good progress on production infrastructure but doesn't meet the success criteria:

**Achievements:**
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ Test pass rate improved from 77% to 82% (157/191 passing)
- ✅ Hybrid Redis/in-memory rate limiting implemented
- ✅ Sentry error tracking integrated

**Issues Requiring Revision:**
- ❌ 34 tests still failing (target was 100%)
- ❌ Authentication flow incomplete
- ❌ User management features not implemented
- ❌ Test coverage below 80% target

### Required Actions for Next Cycle:

1. **Priority 1: Fix Test Failures**
   - Focus on the 34 failing tests
   - Fix authentication component tests
   - Resolve UI validation timing issues

2. **Priority 2: Complete Authentication**
   - Ensure login/signup pages work fully
   - Fix session management
   - Complete auth flow integration

3. **Priority 3: User Management**
   - Implement user profile functionality
   - Add workspace management
   - Complete team invitation system

The PR cannot be merged to main due to incomplete implementation. The work needs to continue in the next cycle to achieve the required test pass rate and complete the authentication features.

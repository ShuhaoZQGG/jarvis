## Review Complete

Cycle 7 has been reviewed and marked as **NEEDS_REVISION**. The PR contains only documentation updates without the actual AI feature implementations that were claimed.

### Summary:
- **Decision**: NEEDS_REVISION
- **PR #4**: Missing implementation code
- **Tests**: Failing with timeouts
- **Required**: Complete implementation of crawler, embeddings, vectors, and RAG components

The development team needs to:
1. Complete the actual implementation
2. Fix test issues
3. Update the PR with real code changes
4. Request re-review

All review documents have been updated with findings and next steps.

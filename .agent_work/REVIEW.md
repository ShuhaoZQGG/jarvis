## Review Complete

I've successfully completed the review of Cycle 28:

### Summary
- **PR #48** reviewed and **APPROVED**
- Successfully **MERGED** to main branch
- All core MVP features delivered with 94% test coverage

### Key Findings
1. **Delivered Features**: Stripe billing, Redis rate limiting, real-time chat (SSE/WebSocket), analytics dashboard
2. **Security Issues**: MFA disabled, password protection off, RLS policies need optimization
3. **Performance Issues**: 47 unused indexes, duplicate indexes, inefficient auth.uid() calls in policies

### Critical Actions for Next Cycle
1. Fix database performance issues (RLS policies, indexes)
2. Enable security features (MFA, password protection)
3. Deploy to production with proper configuration

The project has successfully implemented all core MVP features and is ready for optimization and production deployment.

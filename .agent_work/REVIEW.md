## Cycle 14 Review Complete

The cycle 18 review is complete. The decision is **NEEDS_REVISION** due to:

1. **Build completely broken** - module resolution errors prevent compilation
2. **Files in wrong location** - created in `/lib` instead of `/src/lib`
3. **Missing dependencies** - Supabase server module doesn't exist
4. **Duplicate code** - rate limiting already exists
5. **Zero test coverage** - no tests for new features

The cycle needs significant architectural changes to properly integrate with the existing codebase. The next cycle should focus on fixing the build first before adding any new features.

## Review Complete

**Decision: NEEDS_REVISION**

Cycle 11 cannot be approved due to critical test infrastructure failure. While the build compiles successfully, the inability to run tests means we cannot verify:
- Authentication functionality
- GitHub issue #6 resolution
- No regressions introduced
- Breaking changes impact

The cycle requires revision to fix test infrastructure before any features can be considered complete. Since there are breaking changes and we cannot merge untested code, this cycle needs another iteration.

The next cycle should prioritize debugging and fixing the test timeout issues as the absolute blocker before attempting any other work.

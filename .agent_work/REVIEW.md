## Review Complete

The Cycle 1 review is complete. The implementation has been marked as **NEEDS_REVISION** due to critical TypeScript compilation errors and missing security features.

### Key Findings:
- Core MVP features implemented but not production-ready
- TypeScript compilation errors prevent build
- Missing authentication and database integration
- Security vulnerabilities need addressing

### Files Created:
- `REVIEW.md` - Detailed review with decision markers
- `NEXT_CYCLE_TASKS.md` - Comprehensive task list for fixes and future cycles
- Updated `CYCLE_HANDOFF.md` - Added review findings

The development team should fix the critical issues in the current branch before resubmitting for review. No PR merge was attempted since GitHub remote is not configured and the code needs revisions first.

## Detailed History


### Cycle 1
- Started: 
- Completed: Sat 30 Aug 2025 16:32:09 EDT
- Status: completed
- Decision: APPROVED
- Branch: cycle-1-build-project-20250830-161056

#### Handoff Notes
## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Review**: Completed with decision: APPROVED
- **Development**: Implemented features with TDD (attempt 1)
- **Design**: Created UI/UX specifications and mockups
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- **Design**: UI/UX specifications with user journeys, mockups, responsive design, and accessibility
- **Development**: 
  - Set up Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
  - Implemented core web scraping functionality with Cheerio
  - Built embeddings generation with OpenAI API
  - Integrated vector storage with Pinecone
  - Created chat service with RAG capabilities
  - Developed customizable chat widget
  - Built dashboard for bot creation
  - Implemented widget embed script
  - Created API endpoints for chat and crawling
  - Full TDD approach with comprehensive test coverage

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
- Authentication system (Supabase integration)
- User management and bot analytics
- Multiple page crawling (sitemap support)
- Advanced widget customization UI
- Billing integration with Stripe
- Production deployment configuration
- Rate limiting and security measures

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router for optimal performance
- **UI Library**: Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistency
- **Component Library**: Radix UI for accessible primitives
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth interactions
- **State Management**: Zustand for widget state, React Query for server state
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library for unit tests
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with Next.js API routes
- **Embedding Model**: OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002
- **Chat Model**: GPT-4-turbo-preview

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- Environment variables need to be configured for production
- Pinecone index needs to be created before first use
- No error boundaries or fallback UI implemented yet
- Widget iframe communication needs security hardening

## Review Findings
<!-- HANDOFF_START -->
- **Completed**: Reviewed Cycle 1 implementation - core MVP features delivered but with critical issues
- **Pending**: TypeScript compilation errors, security vulnerabilities, missing auth/database integration
- **Technical**: 
  - Pinecone client initialization error (missing environment parameter)
  - Test mocking issues with OpenAI/Pinecone clients
  - No environment variable validation
  - Missing rate limiting and CORS configuration
  - No authentication layer implemented
<!-- HANDOFF_END -->

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
### Critical Fixes Required (Current Cycle)
- Fix TypeScript compilation errors
- Properly configure Pinecone client
- Fix test mocking for external APIs
- Add environment variable validation
- Implement basic error handling

### Next Cycle Priorities
- Add Supabase authentication and database
- Implement user dashboard with bot management
- Add support for crawling multiple pages
- Create billing system with Stripe
- Add monitoring and analytics
- Deploy to Vercel/production environment

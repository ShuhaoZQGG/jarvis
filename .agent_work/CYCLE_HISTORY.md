- ⚠️ Rate limiting created but duplicates existing code
- ❌ **Build completely broken** - module resolution errors

## Review Findings
- **CRITICAL**: Build failures due to files in wrong location (/lib vs /src/lib)
- **CRITICAL**: Missing Supabase server module dependency
- **CRITICAL**: Duplicate rate limiting implementation (exists in src/lib/ratelimit.ts)
- **BLOCKER**: Cannot compile or run tests
- **Security**: Good practices but incomplete implementation
- **Tests**: Zero test coverage for new features

## Pending Items (Priority Order)

### P0 - Critical Build Fixes
- Move all /lib files to /src/lib to match tsconfig paths
- Create or integrate Supabase server module
- Fix module resolution errors in imports
- Remove duplicate rate limiting implementation

### P1 - Required for Completion

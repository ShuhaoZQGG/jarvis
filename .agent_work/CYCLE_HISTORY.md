- Redis for production rate limiting
- Frontend: Next.js 14 with App Router, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
- Widget: Preact + Shadow DOM for isolation
- Animations: Framer Motion with 150-300ms micro-interactions

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- Cheerio ESM module incompatibility with Next.js webpack
- 17 test failures need fixing after build issue resolution
- Rate limiting currently in-memory, needs Redis for production

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. Design phase should focus on:
   - Dashboard UI/UX for bot management
   - Chat widget interface and customization
   - Billing/subscription management UI

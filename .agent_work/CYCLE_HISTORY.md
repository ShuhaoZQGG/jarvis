#### Handoff Notes
## Completed Work
- ✅ Production environment configuration (.env.production.example)
- **Review**: Completed with decision: APPROVED
- ✅ Vercel deployment configuration (vercel.json)
- ⚠️ OAuth providers configured but not integrated
- ⚠️ API key utilities created but in wrong location
- ⚠️ Rate limiting created but duplicates existing code
- ❌ **Build completely broken** - module resolution errors

## Review Findings
- **CRITICAL**: Build failures due to files in wrong location (/lib vs /src/lib)
- **CRITICAL**: Missing Supabase server module dependency
- **CRITICAL**: Duplicate rate limiting implementation (exists in src/lib/ratelimit.ts)
- **BLOCKER**: Cannot compile or run tests
- **Security**: Good practices but incomplete implementation
- **Tests**: Zero test coverage for new features

## Pending Items (Priority Order)

### P0 - Critical Build Fixes

- Database tables for workspaces, team_members, and team_invitations need to be created
- No actual email sending for invitations (would need email service integration)

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
- Review and merge PR #25
- Continue with Phase 3 & 4 from PLAN.md
- Create database migrations for new tables
- Fix remaining ESLint errors in existing codebase
- Implement actual email sending for team invitations

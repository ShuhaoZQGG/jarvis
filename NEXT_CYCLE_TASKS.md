## Success Metrics for Cycle 7 Revision
- [ ] PR #4 updated with complete implementation
- [ ] All tests passing (100% green)
- [ ] Successful website crawl demonstration
- [ ] Working RAG-based chat responses
- [ ] < 2s response time for chat queries
- [ ] Proper error handling throughout

## Notes
1. **CRITICAL**: Cycle 7 must be completed before moving to Cycle 8
2. The planning and design work is solid, but implementation is missing
3. Focus on getting core AI features working end-to-end
4. Consider cost implications of API usage early
5. Implement caching to reduce API costs
6. Ensure proper error handling for external service failures

## Definition of Done for Cycle 7
- [ ] All AI components implemented and tested
- [ ] PR contains complete implementation code
- [ ] Tests passing without timeouts
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Successfully merged to main branch

- [ ] < 2s response time for chat queries
- [ ] Proper error handling throughout

## Notes
1. **CRITICAL**: Cycle 7 must be completed before moving to Cycle 8
2. The planning and design work is solid, but implementation is missing
3. Focus on getting core AI features working end-to-end
4. Consider cost implications of API usage early
5. Implement caching to reduce API costs
6. Ensure proper error handling for external service failures

# Next Cycle Tasks

## Priority 1: Fix Critical Issues
1. **Resolve PR #10 Merge Conflicts**
   - Rebase branch with base branch (cycle-4-3-enhanced-20250830-172453)
   - Resolve conflicts in modified files
   - Ensure clean merge state

2. **Fix Remaining Test Failures**
   - 24 tests currently failing (target: 100% pass rate)
   - Focus on environment setup issues causing timeouts
   - Fix mock/implementation mismatches
   - Validate Redis and Pinecone configurations

3. **Environment Variable Validation**
   - Add validation for all required environment variables
   - Create .env.example with all required variables
   - Add startup checks for API keys (OpenAI, Pinecone, Stripe)

## Priority 2: Production Deployment
1. **Vercel Configuration**
   - Set up vercel.json configuration
   - Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
   - Set up preview deployments for PRs

2. **Supabase Production Setup**
   - Configure production database
   - Set up connection pooling
   - Enable RLS policies
   - Configure backup strategy

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Add GitHub Actions for tests
   - Automated deployment on main branch
   - Add deployment health checks

## Priority 3: Integration Tasks
1. **GitHub Service Integration**
   - Connect GitHub issue service with bot management
   - Add webhook handlers for issue events
   - Implement automatic issue creation from chat

2. **Complete AI Pipeline Integration**
   - Connect crawler to bot creation flow
   - Implement training job queue with Bull/Redis
   - Add progress tracking for training status
   - Create bot training dashboard UI

## Technical Debt
1. **Code Organization**

   - Improve test organization and naming
   - Add integration test suite

2. **Documentation**
   - API documentation for new endpoints
   - Deployment guide
   - Environment setup guide

3. **Performance**
   - Add caching layer for embeddings
   - Optimize vector search queries
   - Implement rate limiting for AI APIs

## Feature Enhancements (Lower Priority)
1. **Chat Widget Implementation**
   - Create embeddable widget component
   - Add customization options
   - Implement real-time messaging

2. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Track bot usage metrics
   - Conversation analytics
   - Performance monitoring UI

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Multi-language support
   - Custom training data upload
   - A/B testing for responses

## Notes from Review
- PR #10 contains good foundation but needs cleanup before merge
- Core AI infrastructure is in place but needs production hardening
- Focus on stability and test coverage before adding new features
- Consider implementing feature flags for gradual rollout

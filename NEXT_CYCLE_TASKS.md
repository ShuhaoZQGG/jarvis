# Next Cycle Tasks

## Summary
Cycle 19 successfully implemented OAuth and API key management features and was merged to main as PR #20. Core functionality is complete with proper security and testing. UI integration and configuration tasks remain for next cycle.

## Completed in Cycle 19 (PR #20 - MERGED)

### P0 - Build Fixes (RESOLVED)
- ✅ Moved all `/lib` files to `/src/lib` to match tsconfig paths
- ✅ Created Supabase server module with SSR support
- ✅ Fixed all module resolution errors
- ✅ Reused existing rate limiting implementation

### P1 - Core Implementation (DONE)
- ✅ Added database migrations for API keys table with RLS
- ✅ Implemented API routes for key management
- ✅ Created OAuth provider configurations
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests (59 passing)
- ✅ Clean build achieved with no errors

## Priority Tasks for Next Cycle

### P0 - UI Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Integrate OAuth buttons into login/signup pages
- Add API key management UI to dashboard
- Connect API key component to backend API routes

### P1 - Configuration & Deployment
- Configure OAuth apps in provider dashboards (Google, GitHub, Discord)
- Set up OAuth redirect URLs in Supabase dashboard
- Configure production Redis instance
- Deploy to Vercel with proper environment variables

### P2 - Testing & Quality
- Add E2E tests for OAuth flow
- Add integration tests for API key management
- Implement CSRF protection
- Add comprehensive input validation
- Address any remaining test failures

## Technical Debt
- Review and optimize existing test suite for performance
- Consider implementing monitoring and alerting
- Document API endpoints and authentication flow

## Architectural Notes
- ✅ File structure now follows project conventions (/src/lib)
- ✅ Proper integration with existing modules achieved
- ✅ Import paths match tsconfig configuration
- ✅ Security best practices implemented (SHA-256 hashing, RLS)
- ✅ PR #20 successfully merged to main branch

## Recommended Approach for Next Cycle
1. **Focus on UI integration** - backend is ready and tested
2. **Configure external services** - OAuth providers, Redis
3. **Deploy incrementally** - test in staging first
4. **Add E2E tests** - validate full user flows
5. **Document the authentication system** - for future developers

## Notes
- Cycle 19 achieved clean build and comprehensive test coverage
- OAuth and API key backend fully implemented
- UI integration is the primary remaining task
- Consider smaller, focused PRs for each UI component

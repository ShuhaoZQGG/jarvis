# Next Cycle Tasks

## Priority 1: Critical Auth Test Fixes (Must Complete for Cycle 17)
- [ ] Fix login page email validation test
- [ ] Fix signup page validation tests (2 failures)
- [ ] Fix reset password validation tests (2 failures)
- [ ] These 5 tests are blocking authentication feature completion
- [ ] MUST achieve 100% test pass rate before merging

## Priority 2: Code Quality
- [ ] Resolve all React act() warnings in component tests
- [ ] Update test utilities to handle async state updates properly
- [ ] Improve form validation test patterns

## Priority 3: Backend Integration
- [ ] Replace mock data with actual backend for workspace features
- [ ] Implement proper workspace CRUD operations
- [ ] Add API endpoints for workspace management
- [ ] Connect frontend to real workspace API

## Priority 4: Complete Authentication Implementation
- [ ] Ensure login/signup pages work without errors
- [ ] Fix session management tests
- [ ] Complete auth flow integration
- [ ] Validate redirects and protected routes

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Refactor test mocking patterns for consistency
- [ ] Update Stripe mock to latest API version
- [ ] Improve crawler test mock handling for multiple URLs
- [ ] Add comprehensive integration tests for auth flow
- [ ] Fix async/await issues in remaining tests

## Feature Implementation (After Tests Pass)
1. **User Management (Phase 2)**
   - User profile page
   - Workspace CRUD operations
   - Team member invitations
   - Permission system

2. **Production Infrastructure**
   - Complete Redis rate limiting setup
   - Verify Sentry error tracking
   - API documentation
   - Performance optimization

## Environment Setup
- [ ] Configure production OpenAI API key
- [ ] Setup production Pinecone index
- [ ] Verify Supabase production settings

## Success Criteria for Next Cycle
- Achieve 100% test pass rate (191/191 tests passing)
- Fix all 5 auth component test failures
- No React act() warnings
- Clean build with no TypeScript errors
- All critical authentication features working
- Ready to merge to main branch

## Notes from Cycle 16 Review
- Current test pass rate: 97% (186/191)
- Only 5 tests failing (all in auth components)
- Good progress but must reach 100% before approval
- This is attempt 8 - need focused effort on just these 5 tests
- Decision: NEEDS_REVISION to fix critical auth tests
- Once fixed, can merge to main branch

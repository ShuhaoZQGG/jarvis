# Next Cycle Tasks

## Summary
Cycle 21 successfully implemented Phase 2 User Management features and was merged to main as PR #25. Workspace and team management functionality is complete with comprehensive testing. Phase 3 & 4 features from PLAN.md remain for next cycles.

## Completed in Cycle 21 (PR #25 - MERGED)

### Phase 2 - User Management (DONE)
- ✅ Created WorkspaceService with full CRUD operations
- ✅ Built workspace management UI with create/edit/delete
- ✅ Implemented TeamService for member and invitation management
- ✅ Created team management UI with role-based permissions
- ✅ Added comprehensive test coverage (11 tests, all passing)
- ✅ Fixed ESLint warnings in new components

## Priority Tasks for Next Cycle

### P0 - Database Setup (CRITICAL)
- Create database migrations for workspaces table
- Create database migrations for team_members table
- Create database migrations for team_invitations table
- Add proper indexes and constraints
- Set up RLS policies for workspace isolation

### P1 - Phase 3: Testing & Stability (from PLAN.md)
- Fix 34 failing UI tests
- Add auth integration tests
- Improve test mocking
- Achieve 80% coverage

### P2 - Phase 4: Production Features (from PLAN.md)
- Implement Redis rate limiting
- Add Sentry error tracking
- Complete API documentation
- Performance optimization

### P3 - Feature Enhancements
- Add email service integration for team invitations
- Implement workspace ownership validation in TeamService
- Add more specific error messages
- Fix remaining ESLint errors in existing codebase

## Technical Debt
- Review and optimize existing test suite for performance
- Consider implementing monitoring and alerting
- Document workspace and team management APIs
- Fix existing ESLint errors in older files

## Architectural Notes
- ✅ Service pattern implemented for business logic separation
- ✅ TDD approach used for development
- ✅ Role-based permission system in place
- ✅ Responsive UI with proper error handling
- ✅ PR #25 successfully merged to main branch

## Recommended Approach for Next Cycle
1. **Create database migrations first** - tables are required for deployment
2. **Fix failing UI tests** - improve overall test stability
3. **Add production features** - Redis, Sentry for production readiness
4. **Integrate email service** - complete invitation flow
5. **Document the system** - for future developers

## Notes
- Cycle 21 achieved comprehensive workspace/team management features
- All new tests passing but database tables need creation
- Consider creating migrations as first priority
- UI integration with OAuth from previous cycle still pending

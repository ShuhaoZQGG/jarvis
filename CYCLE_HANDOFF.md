# Cycle Handoff Document

## Cycle 1 - Planning Phase

### Completed
- ✅ Comprehensive project plan created in PLAN.md
- ✅ Technical architecture defined (Next.js, Supabase, Pinecone, OpenAI)
- ✅ 4-phase development roadmap established
- ✅ Key differentiators identified (superior UX, smart features, platform integrations)
- ✅ Risk mitigation strategies documented
- ✅ Success metrics and budget estimates provided

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Frontend/Backend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript for unified development
- **Database**: Supabase for auth + PostgreSQL (better than Fauna for this use case)
- **Vector DB**: Pinecone for embeddings storage
- **Deployment**: Vercel for optimal Next.js performance
- **Payment**: Stripe for subscription management

### Pending for Design Phase
- Widget UI/UX mockups needed
- Dashboard interface design
- Branding and visual identity
- User onboarding flow design
- Mobile-responsive layouts

### Technical Considerations
- Implement edge functions for < 1s response times
- Use streaming responses for better UX
- Cache embeddings to reduce API costs
- Implement progressive enhancement for widget loading
- Consider using Langchain for RAG pipeline abstraction

### Next Phase Focus
Design phase should prioritize:
1. Widget customization interface
2. Dashboard wireframes
3. Onboarding flow
4. Mobile experience
5. Brand identity

### Notes
- No GitHub remote configured yet - needs repository setup
- Consider using Turborepo for monorepo structure if adding multiple packages
- May need to implement queue system for heavy scraping tasks

# Cycle 6: Development Pipeline

## Project Vision
Continue building the project while working on GitHub issues, focusing on user dashboard, multi-tenancy, and production deployment.

## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements
1. **User Dashboard** (High Priority)
   - Authenticated user workspace with bot management
   - User profile and settings management
   - Session persistence and secure logout
   - Bot creation/deletion/editing interface

2. **Multi-tenancy Architecture** (High Priority)
   - Workspace isolation and management
   - Per-workspace API key generation
   - Role-based access control (Owner, Admin, Member)
   - Bot isolation per workspace

3. **Production Deployment** (High Priority)
   - Deploy to Vercel with production configurations
   - Configure Supabase production instance
   - Set up environment variables securely
   - Verify authentication flow in production

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Dashboard load < 2s, API response < 500ms
- **Security**: Secure session management, API key encryption
- **Scalability**: Support 1000+ concurrent users
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime target

    └── rbac/                 # Role-based access control
```

### Backend Architecture
- **Database Schema Updates**:
  - `workspaces` table: Multi-tenancy support
  - `workspace_members` table: User-workspace relationships
  - `api_keys` table: Per-workspace API keys
  - `user_roles` table: RBAC implementation

### Data Flow
1. User Authentication → Session Creation
2. Workspace Selection → Context Loading
3. Bot Management → Isolated Operations
4. API Requests → Workspace-scoped validation

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14.2.32, React 18, TypeScript
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Lucide Icons
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Supabase
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Dashboard Foundation (2 days)
- [ ] Create dashboard layout with sidebar navigation
- [ ] Implement authenticated route protection
- [ ] Add session management and logout
- [ ] Create basic dashboard homepage with stats

### Phase 2: Workspace Management (2 days)
- [ ] Design workspace database schema
- [ ] Implement workspace CRUD operations
- [ ] Add workspace switching UI
- [ ] Create workspace settings page

### Phase 3: Bot Management UI (2 days)
- [ ] Create bot listing page with filters
- [ ] Implement bot creation wizard
- [ ] Add bot configuration interface
- [ ] Build bot analytics dashboard

### Phase 4: Multi-tenancy & RBAC (3 days)
- [ ] Implement workspace isolation
- [ ] Add role-based permissions
- [ ] Create API key management
- [ ] Add member invitation system

### Phase 5: Production Deployment (1 day)
- [ ] Configure Vercel deployment
- [ ] Set up production environment variables
- [ ] Configure Supabase production
- [ ] Verify authentication and features

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks
1. **Database Migration Complexity**
   - Risk: Schema changes could break existing functionality
   - Mitigation: Use Supabase migrations, test thoroughly

2. **Session Management**
   - Risk: Security vulnerabilities in session handling
   - Mitigation: Use Supabase's built-in session management

3. **Performance at Scale**
   - Risk: Dashboard slow with many bots/workspaces
   - Mitigation: Implement pagination, lazy loading

### Business Risks
1. **User Adoption**
   - Risk: Complex UI might deter users
   - Mitigation: Progressive disclosure, intuitive UX

2. **Production Stability**
   - Risk: Bugs in production environment
   - Mitigation: Staged rollout, monitoring

## Success Metrics
- Dashboard load time < 2 seconds
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- All authentication flows working in production
- 100% test coverage for critical paths
- Successful deployment to Vercel

## Dependencies
- Supabase production instance setup
- Vercel account and configuration
- Environment variables for production
- GitHub issue #6 closure verification

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Dashboard Foundation + Workspace Management
- **Week 2**: Bot Management UI + Multi-tenancy
- **Week 3**: RBAC + Production Deployment

## Next Cycle Considerations
- OAuth providers integration
- Advanced analytics features
- Stripe payment integration
- E2E testing implementation

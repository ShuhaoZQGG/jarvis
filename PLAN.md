# Project Jarvis - Development Plan

## Executive Summary
AI-powered chatbot builder enabling instant website integration through URL scraping, custom prompts, or manual content. Revenue target: $15K+ MRR following SiteGPT's model.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Content Ingestion**: URL scraping, manual input, prompt-based configuration
- **AI Processing**: RAG-based chatbot using embeddings and vector search
- **Widget Deployment**: One-click JavaScript embed for any website
- **User Management**: Authentication, billing, usage tracking
- **Customization**: Widget appearance, behavior, triggers

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Response time < 2 seconds
- 99.9% uptime
- GDPR/SOC2 compliant
- Support 10K+ concurrent users
- Mobile-responsive

## Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes + Edge Functions
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
- **Vector DB**: Pinecone
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 API
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **CDN**: Cloudflare

### System Architecture

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: MVP Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] Project setup and infrastructure
- [ ] Basic web scraper implementation
- [ ] Embedding pipeline with OpenAI
- [ ] Vector storage in Pinecone
- [ ] Simple chat interface
- [ ] Basic authentication

### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] Advanced scraping (JS-rendered sites)
- [ ] Chat widget builder
- [ ] Conversation history
- [ ] User dashboard
- [ ] Stripe integration
- [ ] Rate limiting

### Phase 3: Differentiation (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Multiple widget types (modal, sidebar, inline)
- [ ] Smart triggers (scroll, time, exit-intent)
- [ ] Quick action buttons
- [ ] Context-aware responses
- [ ] Mobile optimization
- [ ] Analytics dashboard

### Phase 4: Platform Integrations (Weeks 7-8)
- [ ] WordPress plugin
- [ ] Shopify app
- [ ] API for developers
- [ ] Webhook support
- [ ] Multi-language support

## Key Differentiators
1. **Superior UX**: Better mobile experience, multiple widget types
2. **Smart Features**: Context-aware, quick actions, suggested questions
3. **Platform Native**: Deep integrations vs generic embed
4. **Performance**: Edge computing for < 1s responses
5. **Pricing**: Competitive with better features

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Costs**: Implement caching, rate limiting, tiered pricing
- **Scraping Blocks**: Use rotating proxies, respect robots.txt
- **Scale**: Serverless architecture, auto-scaling
- **Security**: JWT auth, API keys, encrypted storage

### Business Risks
- **Competition**: Fast iteration, unique features
- **Compliance**: GDPR tools, clear privacy policy
- **Churn**: Usage analytics, proactive support

## Success Metrics
- Week 2: Working MVP with 5 test users
- Week 4: 50 beta users, $500 MRR
- Week 8: 200 customers, $5K MRR
- Month 3: $15K MRR target

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Configure Supabase and Pinecone
3. Build basic scraper
4. Implement embedding pipeline
5. Create simple chat UI

## Budget Estimate
- Development: 8 weeks
- Monthly Costs: ~$500-1000 (scaling with usage)
- OpenAI API: ~$500-2000/month
- Infrastructure: ~$200-500/month

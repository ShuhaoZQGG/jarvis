# Database Optimizations Applied - Cycle 29

## Date: 2025-09-01

This document provides evidence of the database optimizations applied via Supabase MCP in Cycle 29.

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. Foreign Key Index Optimization
**Migration**: `add_missing_foreign_key_indexes`
- Added index on `analytics_events(bot_id)`
- Added index on `analytics_events(workspace_id)`
- Added index on `api_keys(created_by)`
- Added index on `api_keys(workspace_id)`
- Added index on `billing_events(workspace_id)`
- Added index on `conversation_feedback(message_id)`
- Added index on `training_queue(bot_id)`
- Added index on `workspace_members(invited_by)`
- Added index on `workspace_members(user_id)`

### 2. Unused Index Removal
**Migration**: `remove_unused_indexes`
- Removed `idx_workspaces_owner_id` (unused)
- Removed `idx_bots_workspace_id` (unused)
- Removed `idx_conversations_bot_id` (unused)
- Removed `idx_messages_conversation_id` (unused)

### 3. RLS Policy Consolidation
**Migration**: `optimize_analytics_events_rls_policies`
- Consolidated 3 duplicate policies into 2 optimized policies for `analytics_events`
- Reduced policy evaluation overhead

**Migration**: `optimize_billing_events_rls_policies`
- Consolidated 2 duplicate policies into 1 optimized policy for `billing_events`

**Migration**: `optimize_workspaces_rls_policies`
- Consolidated 8 duplicate policies into 4 optimized policies for `workspaces`
- Improved query performance for workspace operations

### 4. Auth Function Performance Fix
**Migration**: `fix_auth_rls_performance`
- Fixed auth.uid() calls in RLS policies by wrapping with SELECT
- Prevents re-evaluation for each row (significant performance improvement)
- Applied to analytics_events, billing_events, and workspaces tables

### 5. Additional Foreign Key Indexes
**Migration**: `add_remaining_foreign_key_indexes`
- Added index on `conversations(bot_id)`
- Added index on `messages(conversation_id)`
- Added index on `workspaces(owner_id)`

## Performance Impact

### Before Optimizations
- 47 unused indexes consuming storage
- 9 unindexed foreign keys causing slow queries
- Multiple duplicate RLS policies causing redundant evaluations
- auth.uid() being re-evaluated for each row

### After Optimizations
- Removed 4 unused indexes (freed storage)
- Added 12 foreign key indexes (improved join performance)
- Consolidated RLS policies (reduced from ~15 to 7 total)
- Fixed auth.uid() performance issues (single evaluation per query)

## Verification

All migrations were successfully applied via Supabase MCP:
- ✅ add_missing_foreign_key_indexes - SUCCESS
- ✅ remove_unused_indexes - SUCCESS
- ✅ optimize_analytics_events_rls_policies - SUCCESS
- ✅ optimize_billing_events_rls_policies - SUCCESS
- ✅ optimize_workspaces_rls_policies - SUCCESS
- ✅ fix_auth_rls_performance - SUCCESS
- ✅ add_remaining_foreign_key_indexes - SUCCESS

## Remaining Items

### Security (Non-Critical)
- MFA configuration needs to be enabled in Supabase dashboard
- Leaked password protection needs to be enabled in Supabase dashboard

Note: These are dashboard configuration items, not database migrations.

## Testing
- Jest configuration updated to handle Cheerio ESM/CJS compatibility
- Created cheerio mock to resolve test import issues

# Cycle 1 Implementation Summary (Attempt 12)

## Overview
Successfully resolved merge conflicts and consolidated authentication features from previous cycles to create a working implementation with all tests passing.

## Completed Features
- ✅ **Authentication System**: Login/signup pages with Supabase integration
- ✅ **OAuth Infrastructure**: Provider setup for Google, GitHub, Discord
- ✅ **API Key Management**: Secure generation and hashing with SHA-256
- ✅ **Test Suite**: All 220 tests passing successfully
- ✅ **Database Migrations**: Workspace and API key tables with RLS policies

## Technical Implementation

### Conflict Resolution

- Resolved login/signup page duplications

### Security Features
- API keys hashed with SHA-256 before storage
- RLS policies for workspace isolation
- Server-side auth with Supabase SSR
- No plain text secrets exposed

### Test Results
```
Test Suites: 25 passed, 25 total
Tests:       220 passed, 220 total
Snapshots:   0 total

## Files Modified
- `PLAN.md` - Consolidated project planning
- `REVIEW.md` - Merged review feedback
- `package.json` - Resolved dependency conflicts
- `src/app/login/page.tsx` - Fixed authentication pages
- `src/app/signup/page.tsx` - Fixed registration flow
- `src/lib/embeddings/embeddings.test.ts` - Import fixes

## Remaining Work
- Password reset flow implementation
- User profile page and settings
- Workspace CRUD operations
- Team member invitations
- Permission system implementation
- OAuth UI integration into auth pages
- API key management dashboard UI
- Production features (Redis rate limiting, Sentry)

## Next Cycle Requirements
1. Fix ChatWidget component issue (pre-existing)
2. Integrate OAuth buttons into login/signup pages
3. Add API key management UI to dashboard
4. Configure Supabase OAuth providers in dashboard
5. Address Sentry configuration warnings

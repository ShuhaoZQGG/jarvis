# Cycle 11 Implementation (Attempt 3)

## Summary
Fixed critical TypeScript compilation errors and missing functionality to restore build capability. While the build now succeeds, test suite timeout issues prevent full validation.

## Completed
✅ Fixed withAuth middleware to support dynamic route params
✅ Implemented missing DatabaseService methods
✅ Fixed OpenAI import shim issues
✅ Corrected all test mock types
✅ Added jest-dom types to test setup
✅ Build completes successfully

## Issues
❌ Test suite times out after 2 minutes
❌ Unable to verify test pass rate
❌ Cannot confirm all features work end-to-end

## Technical Changes
- Modified withAuth middleware signature to accept route context
- Added updateWorkspace, deleteWorkspace, getWorkspaceMembers to DatabaseService
- Fixed VectorStore constructor calls in tests
- Added timestamp field to ScrapedPage mocks
- Added created_at field to Workspace mocks

## Next Steps
1. Debug test timeout root cause
2. Fix async handling in tests
3. Achieve 100% test pass rate
4. Complete integration testing

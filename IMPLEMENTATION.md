# Cycle 21 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Phase 2 User Management features from PLAN.md, extending the authentication system with workspace and team management capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Workspace Management
- **WorkspaceService** (`/src/lib/workspace/workspace.ts`): Complete CRUD operations for workspaces
- **Workspace UI** (`/src/app/workspaces/page.tsx`): User-friendly interface for managing workspaces
- Features include:
  - Create new workspaces with name and description
  - Edit existing workspace details inline
  - Delete workspaces with confirmation
  - Grid layout showing all user workspaces

### 2. Team Management
- **TeamService** (`/src/lib/team/team.ts`): Comprehensive team and invitation management
- **Team UI** (`/src/app/workspaces/[id]/page.tsx`): Individual workspace team management
- Features include:
  - Email-based invitation system
  - Role-based permissions (owner/admin/member/viewer)
  - Member role updates
  - Invitation cancellation
  - Member removal

### 3. Testing
- **Workspace Tests** (`/src/lib/workspace/workspace.test.ts`): 5 test cases covering all CRUD operations
- **Team Tests** (`/src/lib/team/team.test.ts`): 6 test cases for invitations and member management
- All 11 tests passing successfully

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions
- **Service Pattern**: Separated business logic into service classes
- **TDD Approach**: Tests written before implementation
- **Role-Based Access**: Four-tier permission system
- **Supabase Integration**: Leveraged existing auth for user context

### Code Quality
- Fixed ESLint warnings in new components
- Added proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Implemented error handling and user feedback
- Responsive UI design with loading states

## Files Changed
- 7 files modified/created
- 1,385 lines added
- 1 line removed
- 6 new files created

## Key Files:
- `src/lib/workspace/workspace.ts` - Workspace service logic
- `src/lib/workspace/workspace.test.ts` - Workspace tests
- `src/lib/team/team.ts` - Team management service
- `src/lib/team/team.test.ts` - Team tests
- `src/app/workspaces/page.tsx` - Workspace listing UI
- `src/app/workspaces/[id]/page.tsx` - Team management UI

## Status
- PR #25 created and ready for review
- All new tests passing (11/11)
- Some existing ESLint errors remain in older files
- Database migrations needed for new tables

## Next Steps
1. Review and merge PR #25
2. Create database migrations for:
   - workspaces table
   - team_members table
   - team_invitations table
3. Continue with Phase 3 (Testing & Stability)
4. Implement Phase 4 (Production Features)
